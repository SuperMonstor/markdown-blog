## **How to 10x your income by leveraging price parity between currencies**

I'm assuming most of my followers are from India/SEA and I would highly encourage my readers who can work in digital domains to leverage the price parity between your local currencies and that of the west.Now, this process isn't that straightforward and took me a lot of trial and error to figure out. However, I have tried to simplify this process as much as I can and turn it into a repeatable framework for you to leverage.Broadly speaking, there are two ways you can go about this. One, you build up your skills and make your employer an offer to work at a rate significantly higher than what you're getting paid right now, but still lower than what they'd have to pay to hire someone local to their region. This is probably the easiest and best way to get started as the value you offer is easier to discern to the client.The second way would be to make an offer where you get paid as much or even more than what they'd pay someone local to their region. This is much trickier, takes a long time to get going, and more risk on your part. It involves making a completely unique value proposition that's unique to the marketplace so that you can basically charge what you want, and also possessing the ability to deliver on them.In this post, I'm going to be dealing with the first method since it's way more straight forward. I'll also touch upon how you can position yourself to make equivalent/more money than their local counterpart by making yourself irreplaceable later.

## **Requirements:**

You have to get really good at what you do. There's no two ways about it. The second you decide to look for opportunities outside your location you are competing on the global stage, and your skills need to match them. Even if you somehow manage to convince someone to hire you while unqualified, it won't serve you in the long run if you're all bark and no bite. You can only put up a charade for so long.I have only really done this for the two things I'm really good at – building businesses and tech, so a lot of my recommendations are going to be around those. However, I'll keep my suggestions malleable enough so they can apply to any profession.

## **Which skill should I pick?**

You should ideally pick a skill you have a bit of experience in, and are inclined towards. Don't simply base your decision off money.While it's true that a UI/UX designer will make significantly less than a software engineer, you can never compete with someone who loves what they do. If you don't take pride in your work, you will never be as good as someone who is. Once you start making money it won't matter beyond a point if you hate what you do, and more likely than not you'll burn out.So my best piece of advice would be, if you are currently in a software engineering job but are more inclined toward the arts, pick something more creative. If you're into writing, learn copywriting. There are infinite ways to add value, and most of the time picking what makes you the most money is the wrong call.It is a process of trial and error, and don't rush it. Once you find "the thing" you won't have any question about it.Just make sure it's something you can service through the internet, or something you can do remote.

## **Get good:**

Spend 6-8 months getting really good at what you do, and build a portfolio of projects that you can show off to people. Avoid creating "clones" of stuff, and work on your own projects. Bring what you want to exist to life.Ideally what you should also do at this point if you can is work freelance. Your first couple projects just work for free. Reach out to people you admire online and say you'll work on something for them, or better yet, work on it without asking and send it to them directly. Their approval will add a lot when you apply to a job eventually, and even if they don't respond you have a great portfolio item.A good way to know when you're ready to move on to the next step is when you start looking at other people's work critically and you find things you can improve."Proof of work". If you think you aren't worthy of the job, you probably aren't. Build evidence to say otherwise.

## **Start applying:**

I'm gonna give you a slightly out-of-the-way strategy here to increase your odds of getting a job.What you need to do is you need to find companies who are hiring remote. Plenty of job boards to do this. Then, you use a tool like

[http://hunter.io](http://hunter.io/)

to scrape their email and reach out to whoever is incharge of their recruitment directly.Here's what you need to include in your email to maximise your chances of getting a reply:

- Talk about the work you've done so far and tie that in to how you can improve the product/service of the company
- Go in detail and suggest changes/improvements you can make. Be as specific as you can be.
- So this is optional, but if you want to truly maximise your chances of landing the job, talk about how hiring you is going to be cheaper than hiring someone local and for better work.

If you know they're looking for a job, the right email would be an offer they can't refuse.

## **It's a numbers game:**

Reach out to at least 25 companies a day. Ideally 50. Do this for a week or two.If you have the skills, you should be drowning in calls at this point.If you want something more stable prioritise reaching out to med-large businesses. A lot of the times they tend to prefer someone local though, but if you end up landing them it'll be way more stable. This is what I'd recommend for most people. However, you can be replaced very easily and it'll take a long time for you to make yourself irreplaceable.You can also look into startups, but it's way riskier. They will offer you equity, but imo you should prioritise cash as much as possible because the chances of you seeing a return is insanely low. However, it is much easier to make yourself irreplaceable in a startup and if it works out the experience you gain will be priceless.

## **Nailing the interview:**

Never be the first one to give a price, period. If they ask how much money you'd like, your only response should be – "How much can you offer?"I can't tell you the number of times people screw themselves over by giving a number.Anyway, if you actually know what you're doing, you shouldn't worry too much about the interview imho. If you followed the process so far, you should be extremely skilled and have tons of leads so, chill out. Answer all questions honestly.If an interview process is akin to something out of a fortune 500 company in silicon valley, it's generally a sign that the company isn't that experienced or they have way too many applicants. Ideally, the best interviews are the ones that reflect the work you'll be doing every day.Also, do not undervalue yourself just because you are from a place where the price parity is low. I've seen this quite often. If you have the skills, no reason you shouldn't be paid as much as the next person.

## **The Job:**

You got multiple offers. Hurray!But you're just getting started. Your only goal while on the job is making your employers depend on you. Do not give away your secrets, find ways and secrets that only you know.For instance, if you're running a marketing job, set up systems that only you know how to run. If you're programming, go out of your way to write programs that improve workflow, but ensure that you're the only one who understands them in their entirety.While this may come off as deceptive or cunning, you have to realise that your value to the company is not as a person, but as a product of their bottom line. It may be sad, but it is true. So your job is not to make the company the most money, but rather, find ways to add value to the company that only you can provide.

## **Conclusion:**

This is a long and arduous process, but it'll all be worth it when the equivalent of a couple months salary hits your bank account every 2 weeks.I tried to make this post concise so I couldn't delve into the specifics of everything, however, let me know if you have any questions and I'll elaborate.
