One learning from Robert Greene was that you can’t be too self absorbed. People who are extremely insecure think more about themselves than they do about the moment they’re in, the people they’re interacting with.

I think on the contrary, you can’t be too outward facing either. You can’t come off as someone who’s hunting or have some kind of innuendo in interactions. You have to be outward facing, pay full attention to the people around you, while also being within yourself and not disregarding who you are completely.

You have to be willing to go after new experiences while keeping an open mind, without having a set outcome. People can sense it when you do, and it can come off as unappealing. You want to chase joy, you want to chase the elixir of life, not people. You want to come off as someone who wants to make the most out of life, and as someone who let’s their intuitions guide them. Finding that balance is difficult, but also freeing.

You may have heard of the saying – “you’ll never find love when you’re looking for it.” I think this is the reason. I’ve heard so many stories of people who found a relationship at the cusp of giving up forever, and that is because they weren’t looking for a relationship whenever they met someone they’d like to be around. They aren’t too outward facing. They’re themselves. And that’s appealing.
