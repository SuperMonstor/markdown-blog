We tend to be quite gullible when it comes to accurately determining who a person really is.

When we meet someone for the first time, we’re quick to judge based on outward appearances, the way they speak, carry themselves, etc. not realising that this is an outward front they present and it’s not indicative of who they are.

We are all deceivers because we want something out of other people. Recognition, attention, praise, the feeling of inclusion. We ourselves put up a front for other people under the hopes that people perceive us to be a certain way, and we are successful a decent portion of the time. If you do this, isn’t it natural that everyone is as well?

Reputation and public perception gives people an unfair advantage. If multiple people around you believe that a person is good at something, you’re likely to believe it as well without any evidence. This is quite dangerous because if people start relying on this person for that thing they more than likely will not be able to deliver. Worse yet, they can manipulate and deceive you.

You see this with musicians all the time. If the internet tells you that a certain artist is good, your perception of how good they are goes up before even listening to them. The same goes for other people as well.

If you’re the person with the reputation, you have a certain degree of power because people will willing to look past your weaknesses and downfalls because of your reputation. It’s a smoke screen.

Also, your perception of how a person should be can blind you to who they are and their past actions. Especially true during romantic relationships when people look past glaring red flags because of an ideal they built up in their head.

It makes sense as to why we’re quick to judge – it’s a lot of effort to find evidence to understand who a person really is for everyone. However, it also makes us gullible because people who are really good at hiding who they are can take advantage of you.

It is worthwhile for the people who truly matter to look through all this and try to see people for who they really are. You do this by finding evidence, patterns in their past, and connecting them to their actions in their present.

It was always right in front of our eyes, we were just never looking for them.
