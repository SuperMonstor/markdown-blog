## **What type of a person are you?**

**Narcissist:**

When you're self-absorbed and self-indulgent to the detriment of the people around you. This largely comes from a place of insecurity because you feel the need to feel superior to the people around you to validate your own self-worth.

**Needy:**

The way you conduct yourself is largely dictated by your concern for what other people might think of you. You're afraid of offending or being disliked by people, so you conform, giving up who you are for the shell of the person you perceive to be liked by everyone.

This is extremely dishonest because you're deceiving people into liking you. You're putting on a show, and people will take you for the person who you really aren't. You can only maintain this facade for so long because eventually, the armor will crack, and your true nature will bleed out. People will resent you for it.

You're better off being yourself completely, and part of that is being okay with being disliked for who you are. A needy person will meet someone and think, "Does this person like me?" while a confident person will meet someone and think, "Do I like them?"

A needy person will be dejected when someone doesn't like them because their self-worth hinges on whether the people around them like them or not. A confident person will understand that being rejected by someone is for the better because you'd rather find someone who likes you for who you really are.

**Confident:**

A confident person finds the right balance between their concern for themselves and their concern for others. They understand that what other people think and do is largely out of their control, so they choose to focus on improving themselves, their perception of things that happen to them, and the actions within their control.

They are honest and upfront about their emotions and desires, and they do it because they're true to themselves regardless of what other people think about them. This is what most people find extremely attractive.

## **How to be confident: be unapologetically you**

When you do something, the intent matters as much as the action.

For example, while complimenting someone, a needy person does it for the approval of someone else ("I hope this person will like me"). A narcissistic person will do it from a place of entitlement ("This person is mine"). A confident person will do it for its own sake and will only dish out compliments they genuinely believe in ("I think this person is beautiful"). People don't get enough credit for detecting this right off the bat.

The reason people don't like it if someone were to go over the top right from the get-go to try and impress them - dating, business, whatever - is because they haven't done anything to warrant it yet. If the person feels the need to do so much to impress them, most likely it's because they don't hold enough intrinsic value and they're trying to compensate. It's a sign of neediness and is repulsive.

So, be honest about your feelings, thoughts, and desires. State things upfront, and don't take things so personally. You will be rejected by a whole lot of people who woudn't like you anwyay, but you'll also find a group of people who you can be authentically yourself around. A whole new world will open up for you.
