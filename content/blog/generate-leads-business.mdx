You start by answering two questions:

1. Who is your customer?
2. What is the problem you’re solving for them

They may seem simple, but coming up with specific answers to both are quite tricky.

You want to try to find the customer who stands to benefit the most from your services (ideally with a measurable, desirable ROI) and solve a problem for them in its entirety.

In its entirety being key here – most customers do not want to piece together the solution.

Let’s say dentists in your area are struggling to get clients online. You not only want to help them set up a website and get online, but also generate leads by running ads, content, and raising awareness for their services. You can’t just build a website and leave it at that.

> Problem: Online customer acquisition is a challenge
> Your customer: Dentists in my area

From all the clients I’ve consulted, their answers are usually something along the lines of:

> Problem: Businesses in my area
> Customer: Anyone who needs a website

If you don’t know who your customer is, it’s hard to come up with a marketing strategy that isn’t extremely expensive and time consuming. If you know you’re selling to dentists, a quick google search will get you all the clients you need.
